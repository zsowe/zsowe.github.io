  navu atta, an ambient full length release & full-length visual effort <br/>
  made          over           the       course       of       2 years. <br/>
  the name is derived from native american and buddhist concepts     of <br/>
  astral projection,   depersonalisation,   and out-of-body experiences <br/>
  musically, the album straddles the line between  potent  dissociative <br/>
  and cathartic emotional release as   myriads    of   detailed   synth <br/>
  flourishes and almost familiar melodies give    way   to    cavernous <br/>
  disintegrated textures, found     sound     and    vinyl   artifacts. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the approach to the film is much the same;   a  collage  of  hundreds <br/>
  of stolen moments collected over years and manipulated   or distorted <br/>
  in         post       often       to      unrecognisable      effect, <br/>
  motifs do arise - electrical light, celestial bodies,  vast  natural, <br/>
  liminal  human  spaces,   and the relative absence of human subjects. <br/> 
  <br/>
  the subject of the film is a mute observer,   evoking   the   titular <br/>
  shoshone     concept     of     navuesheip    or    "wandering soul", <br/>
  which is free to leave the body during dreams or  trancelike  states. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  technically, this album and film were made through a daily process of <br/>
  recording     and     editing      most     comparable    to collage. <br/>
  daily recording sessions primarily used      the     deepmind     12, <br/>
  ibanez     electric     bass   and a  yamaha    electric    keyboard, <br/>
  played to    Alice   Coltrane,   Sun   Ra,   and   Azymuth   records. <br/>
  these    long     improvisational     sessions    would    then    be <br/>
  ruthlessly  manipulated, deconstructed and  re-arranged in fl-studio. <br/>
  <br/>
  Tim Hecker fans should feel quite at home with the use of progressive <br/>
  motifs played over      disintegrated       rhythmic      structures, <br/>
  and free/spirital jazz appreciators may recognise influences  in  the <br/>
  occasional      degraded      sample      or      echoed      phrase. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  visually the material is more grounded, frequently involving ordinary <br/>
  locations, while taking us through     a    variety   of   settings - <br/>
  rock formations, forests, and architecture all take on   a   haunting <br/>
  quality when emptied of their people, who are     all   either   just <br/>
  out        of       frame      or     faceless       and     distant. <br/>
  the   title   sequence   perfectly   summarises   this   alienation - <br/>
  <br/>
  in the mountains    an   elegant   woman   dressed   in    all   red, <br/>
  twirling      a    parasol,    poses     for     photos   in    front <br/>
  of         the         tower        at          huang    mua    peak. <br/>
  observed    from   a    distance,  at   300   feet   above    ground, <br/>
  she     is    cast   against   a  backdrop  of  enormous   emptiness. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  there      is      no       particualr       mission        statement <br/>
  or         manifesto       relating      to       this      project - <br/>
  our priority is simply the aesthetics that appeal to   us as artists. <br/>
  we only wish to     present    a     work     that    people      can <br/>
  draw          their          own         interpretation         from. <br/>
  navu atta has been    described    back     to    us   in  opposites, <br/>
  as   both  meditative  and  dissociative, comforting and challenging. <br/>
  <br/>
  the above is merely intended as      a      frame     of    reference <br/>
  as to how the project was made and  an  insight  into  the  approach. <br/>

          denizen forest is my first, mostly solo effort. <br/>
          a project done in order to start releasing as 'zsowe'-<br/>
          which meant as a collaborative project, led by myself,<br/>
          often features people and artists from my life as <br/>
          collaborators, helping to realise the vision.
          <br/><br/>
          the project is a collection of 5 tracks that differ genre wise,<br/>
          as well as stylistically, whilst keeping the energy and atmosphere in <br/>
          the same playing field, transitioning each track into the next,<br/>
          creating a seamless listening experience.
          <br/><br/>
          visually, the short films for denizen forest are first attempts at <br/>
          collaging my footage to the music in order to <br/>
          include the visual medium into the zsowe project. <br/>
          <br/>
          denizen forest showcases the beginnings of the style and direction<br/>
          of the work that is to come in the future.
