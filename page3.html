    navu atta, an ambient full length release & full-length visual effort made over the course of 2 years. <br/>
  the name is derived from native american and buddhist concepts of astral projection, <br/>
  depersonalisation, and out-of-body experiences. <br/>
  <br/>
  musically, the album straddles the line between potent dissociative and cathartic emotional release <br/>
  as myriads of detailed synth flourishes and almost familiar melodies give way to cavernous <br/>
  disintegrated textures, found sound and vinyl artifacts.<br/>
  <br/>

  the approach to the film is much the same; a collage of hundreds of stolen moments <br/>
  collected over years and manipulated or distorted in post, often to unrecognisable effect, <br/>
  motifs do arise - electrical light, celestial bodies, vast natural structures, <br/>
  liminal human spaces, and the relative absence of human subjects. <br/>
  <br/>
  the subject of the film is a mute observer, evoking the titular Shoshone concept of navusheip <br/>
  or "wandering soul", which is free to leave the body during dreams or trancelike states. <br/>
<br/>
  technically, this album and film were made through a daily <br/>
  process of recording and editing most comparable to collage. <br/>
  daily recording sessions primarily used the deepmind 12, ibanez electric bass <br/>
  and a yamaha electric keyboard, played to Alice Coltrane, Sun-Ra, and Azymuth records. <br/>
  these long, improvisational sessions would then be ruthlessly manipulated, deconstructed <br/>
  and re-arranged in fl studio. Tim Hecker fans should feel quite at home with the use of <br/>
  progressive motifs over disintegrated rhythmic structures, and free/spiritual jazz appreciators <br/>
  may recognise influences in the occasional degraded sample or echoed phrase. <br/>
  <br/>
  visually the material is more grounded, frequently involving ordinary <br/>
  locations, while taking us through a variety of settings - <br/>
   rock formations, forests, and architecture all take on a haunting <br/>
  quality when emptied of their people, who are all either just out of frame or <br/>
  faceless and distant. the title sequence perfectly summarises this alienation - <br/>
  <br/>
  in the mountains an elegant woman dressed in all red, <br/>
  twirling a parasol, poses for photos in front <br/>
  of the tower at hang m√∫a peak. <br/>
  observed from a distance, at 300 feet above ground, <br/>
  she is cast against a backdrop of enormous emptiness. <br/>
  <br/>
  there is no particular mission statement or manifesto relating to this project - <br/>
  our priority is simply the aesthetics that appeal to us as artists. <br/>
  we only wish to present a work that people can draw their own interpretation from. <br/>
  navu atta has been described back to us in opposites, as both meditative and dissociative, <br/>
  comforting and challenging. the above is merely intented as a frame of reference <br/>
  as to how the project was made and an insight into the approach.

          denizen forest is my first, mostly solo effort. <br/>
          a project done in order to start releasing as 'zsowe'-<br/>
          which meant as a collaborative project, led by myself,<br/>
          often features people and artists from my life as <br/>
          collaborators, helping to realise the vision.
          <br/><br/>
          the project is a collection of 5 tracks that differ genre wise,<br/>
          as well as stylistically, whilst keeping the energy and atmosphere in <br/>
          the same playing field, transitioning each track into the next,<br/>
          creating a seamless listening experience.
          <br/><br/>
          visually, the short films for denizen forest are first attempts at <br/>
          collaging my footage to the music in order to <br/>
          include the visual medium into the zsowe project. <br/>
          <br/>
          denizen forest showcases the beginnings of the style and direction<br/>
          of the work that is to come in the future.
